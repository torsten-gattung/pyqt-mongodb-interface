# Quick M.E

Original version: https://github.com/aziznal/pyqt-mongodb-interface

## Description

***Quick M.E.*** is a graphical interface for using mongoDB.
It allows all the basics, and more advanced things, like assign custom functions to buttons, and even export a database or collection in JSON format

this is meant as an exercise for myself, as well as a convenient way to do some stuff with mongoDB since I use it in a lot of my other projects
